The souvenir in the image appears to be a wooden clock stand with a round, gold-toned quartz clock inserted into\ it. Here's a general idea of how you might go about making a similar item:

1. Design and Planning:
- Sketch the design of the clock stand, including dimensions and the size of the recess for the clock insert.
- Choose the type of wood you would like to use, considering its workability and finish.
2. Woodworking:
- Cut a piece of wood to the size required for the stand.
- Shape the wood to the desired profile. This could involve cutting angles and curves to achieve the block-like shape seen in the image.
- Sand the wood to a smooth finish.
3. Creating the Recess for the Clock:
- Measure the diameter of the clock insert.
- Use a Forstner bit attached to a drill press to create a hole just slightly larger than the clock diameter, so the clock can fit snugly into the wood.
- Sand any rough edges within the recess.
4. Finishing:
- Apply a stain or sealant to the wood, if desired, to enhance the color and grain.
- Follow up with a coat of wood finish, such as polyurethane, to protect the wood and give it a polished look.
5. Assembling:
- Insert the quartz clock into the recess. Depending on the fit, you may need to use adhesive or a friction fit to secure the clock in place.
6. Additional Customization:
- Add felt pads to the bottom to prevent scratching surfaces.
- Personalize the stand with engravings or decorations if desired.
- For a precise and professional result, it's essential to use the right tools and materials and have a good understanding of woodworking techniques. If you're not experienced with woodworking, you may want to consult with a professional or consider starting with a simpler project to develop your skills.





The side view of the wooden clock souvenir reveals that it is designed to resemble a threaded bolt and nut, a creative and interesting concept for a clock stand. Crafting such an item would involve advanced woodworking skills and precise tooling. Here is a step-by-step guide on how you might craft this object:

1. Design and Planning:
Sketch detailed plans for the bolt and nut shapes, including threads and dimensions for the clock recess.
Choose a suitable hardwood for the project that will allow for detailed work and threads.
2. Cutting the Basic Shapes:
Begin with a block of wood that is larger than the final dimensions of your bolt and nut.
Use a bandsaw or handsaw to cut the wood into the rough shape of the bolt and nut.
3. Carving the Threads:
Threads can be particularly challenging to create. Use a lathe to turn the wood and create the cylindrical shapes for the bolt and the hole in the nut.
For the threads, you could use a threading tool while the wood is still on the lathe, carefully carving out the spiral threads on both the bolt and the inside of the nut.
If you do not have a threading tool or a lathe with a threading capability, you may need to carve the threads by hand using a chisel, which requires a lot of skill and patience.
4. Creating the Clock Recess:
Determine the size of the clock mechanism you will be inserting.
While the bolt part is still on the lathe, drill a hole to the appropriate depth and diameter for the clock insert. This will likely be on one end of the bolt shape.
Sand the interior of the recess until it is smooth and the clock insert fits snugly.
5. Sanding and Finishing:
Once the threads and recess are complete, sand the entire piece thoroughly to prepare it for finishing.
Apply a wood finish of your choice, such as tung oil, Danish oil, or a clear coat that will protect the wood and enhance its natural beauty.
6. Assembly:
Carefully thread the nut onto the bolt to ensure it fits well.
Insert the clock into the recess and secure it. Depending on the fit, you may need adhesive or a retention mechanism.
Add any additional features such as rubber feet to prevent sliding or scratching surfaces.
Creating this souvenir requires a good understanding of woodworking techniques and the use of specialized tools, especially for the thread work. If you're a beginner, it might be a good idea to start with simpler projects and work your way up to more complex ones like this. If you're not experienced or comfortable with these tools and techniques, seeking the assistance of a professional woodworker could be a safer way to achieve your goal.
